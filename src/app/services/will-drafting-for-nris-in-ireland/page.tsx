const NRI_IRELAND_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Does Section 111 of the Irish Succession Act apply to Indian property?",
    a: "No. Under Section 5 of the Indian Succession Act 1925, succession to land and homes in India is governed only by Indian law. Irish courts cannot directly control land in India. But if you use a single worldwide Will, Irish court probate stalls land records in India. A separate Indian Will prevents these spouse legal right share conflicts.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT 33%) affect Indian inheritances?",
    a: "In Ireland, CAT at 33% applies if you live in Ireland and inherit property. Irish Revenue taxes inheritances above group tax-free thresholds. A separate Indian Will gives clear proof of Indian asset location and ownership. This helps your accountant manage tax filings cleanly and avoid double tax.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can NRIs in Dublin or Cork sign an Indian Will on plain paper?",
    a: "Yes. Under Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act 1925, you can sign your Will on plain A4 paper in Ireland. You do not need Indian non-judicial stamp paper while living abroad. You only need two adult witnesses who watch you sign. Your witnesses must not be beneficiaries named in the Will.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) apostille in Dublin?",
    a: "Two adult witnesses make your Will valid under Indian law. You do not need an apostille to make it legal. But having an Irish Notary stamp and a DFA apostille gives strong proof. This stops false challenges by relatives before Indian land offices and courts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get my Will attested at the Embassy of India in Dublin instead?",
    a: "Yes. The Embassy of India in Dublin (19 Upper Leeson Street, Dublin 4) provides consular attestation for NRIs. You can sign your Will before the consular officer. This gives clear legal proof in Indian courts and land offices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why should NRIs in Ireland avoid a single combined worldwide Will?",
    a: "A single combined Will causes serious delays. Standard Irish will clauses can accidentally cancel your Indian Will. Also, Indian land offices reject Irish probate orders. Indian courts demand ancillary probate under Section 228, which takes years. Two separate Wills eliminate this problem completely.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are Indian NRE, NRO, and Demat accounts claimed from Ireland?",
    a: "Under the Supreme Court ruling in Sarbati Devi, bank nominees are only caretakers. Nominees do not own the money. A clear Indian Will names your true heirs. This lets your family claim bank funds and demat shares quickly without an expensive court succession certificate.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can heirs in Ireland repatriate funds from Indian property sales?",
    a: "Heirs first update land records using the Will. When selling the property, they apply for a Lower TDS Certificate under Section 197 to avoid a 20% tax cut. Under RBI rules, heirs can send up to 1 million USD per year to Ireland through an NRO account using Form 15CA and Form 15CB.",

                Over 61,000 Indian professionals and families live across Dublin,
                Cork, Galway, and Limerick. Under the Irish Succession Act 1965,
                succession defaults to your Irish domicile. Without a separate
                Indian Will, Irish probate papers face years of delays in Indian
                courts. A standalone Indian Will protects your flats, ancestral
                land, and bank accounts. Our High Court advocates draft ironclad
                Wills to protect your family from cross-border disputes.

                    <strong>Section 111 Legal Right Share Clash:</strong> Under
                    Irish law, a surviving spouse has a statutory right to one-third
                    or one-half of the estate. Using an Irish Will to cover Indian
                    real estate creates severe title disputes in India.

                Neither country levies estate duty. In India, inheritances under a Will are tax-free. In Ireland, Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) at 33% applies above lifetime group limits. When selling inherited Indian land or flats later, capital gains tax applies. Indian buyers must deduct tax under Section 195. Our legal team helps you secure a Lower TDS Certificate under Section 197. This stops high tax deductions upfront.

                Under RBI rules, heirs can send up to 1 million USD per year to Ireland. You use an NRO bank account with Form 15CA and Form 15CB. Under the India-Ireland tax treaty, you avoid double tax. Taxes paid in India can be credited in Ireland.
