const NRI_RUSSIA_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Does Part III of the Russian Civil Code apply to my Indian properties?",
    a: "Under Article 1224 of the Russian Civil Code, the succession of real estate follows the law where the land is located. Indian courts apply Indian succession law to Indian land and homes. A separate Indian Will ensures your Indian assets transfer smoothly without Russian notary delays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can NRIs in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or Kursk sign an Indian Will on plain paper?",
    a: "Yes. Under Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, you can sign your Will on plain A4 paper. You do not need Indian stamp paper in Russia. You only need two adult witnesses who watch you sign. Your witnesses must not be heirs named in the Will.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need consular attestation from the Indian Embassy in Moscow?",
    a: "Two adult witnesses make your Will valid under Indian law. But an attestation from the Indian Embassy in Moscow or Consulate in Saint Petersburg provides strong proof. This stops probate disputes. It also speeds up property transfers before Indian offices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why should NRIs in Russia avoid a single worldwide Will?",
    a: "A single worldwide Will causes court delays. Indian registries do not accept Russian notary papers directly. Getting ancillary probate in India requires certified translations and years in court. Two separate Wills let both estates settle fast.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can Indian medical graduates and doctors in Russia protect ancestral property?",
    a: "Thousands of Indian medical doctors and graduates in Russia hold ancestral property shares in India. An Indian Will separates ancestral coparcenary rights from self-bought wealth. It names your legal heirs. It also gives your executor power to handle society and land updates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are Indian NRE, NRO, and Demat accounts claimed from Russia?",
    a: "Bank and depository nominees act only as temporary caretakers under the Supreme Court Sarbati Devi ruling. Nominees do not own the money. A clear Indian Will names your true heirs. This lets your family claim bank funds and shares quickly without a civil court succession certificate.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do banking sanctions affect inheritance transfers between India and Russia?",
    a: "Indian inherited assets remain safe within the regulated Indian banking system under RBI guidelines. Heirs can hold funds in NRO accounts. You can also send up to 1 million USD per year to Russia or abroad using an NRO account with Form 15CA and Form 15CB.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Russia or India levy inheritance tax on inherited estates?",
    a: "Neither country levies inheritance tax. Russia ended estate tax in 2006, and India ended estate duty in 1985. But selling inherited Indian land later brings capital gains tax. Under Article 13 of the India-Russia tax treaty, taxes paid in India can be credited in Russia.",

                Neither India nor Russia levies estate duty or inheritance tax. You
                inherit Indian assets tax-free. But selling real estate later brings
                capital gains tax. Indian buyers must deduct tax under Section 195.
                Our legal team helps you get a Lower TDS Certificate under Section 197.
                This saves you from high tax cuts upfront.

                Under RBI rules, heirs can transfer up to 1 million USD per year to
                Russia or abroad. You use an NRO bank account with Form 15CA and Form 15CB. Under
                Article 13 of the India-Russia tax treaty, double tax is avoided.
