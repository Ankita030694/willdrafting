const NRI_ISRAEL_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Does Israeli Inheritance Law 5725-1965 apply to my assets in India?",
    a: "Under Section 137 of Israeli Inheritance Law, your home city at death sets the basic rule. But Section 138 respects local property laws for real estate abroad. Indian courts apply Indian succession law to Indian land and flats. Having a separate Indian Will ensures Indian law governs your Indian wealth without cross-border delay.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can NRIs in Israel execute an Indian Will on plain paper?",
    a: "Yes. Under Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, you can sign your Will on plain A4 paper. You do not need Indian stamp paper while living in Israel. You only need two adult witnesses who watch you sign. Your witnesses must not be heirs named in the Will.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an Israeli Notary apostille from the Ministry of Justice?",
    a: "Two adult witnesses make your Will valid under Indian law. But an Israeli Notary stamp and a Ministry of Justice apostille give strong proof. This stops family disputes in India. It also speeds up property transfers before local municipal bodies.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why should NRIs in Israel avoid a single worldwide Will?",
    a: "A single worldwide Will causes court delays. An Israeli probate order is not accepted directly by Indian land offices. Indian courts require ancillary probate under Section 228 with certified Hebrew translations. Two separate Wills let both estates settle fast without court roadblocks.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can Bene Israel families protect ancestral property in India?",
    a: "Many families in Ashdod, Beersheba, and Tel Aviv own ancestral houses or tenanted flats in Maharashtra and Kerala. A clear Indian Will names your specific share. It lists all Class-I heirs. It also gives your executor power to complete Housing Society transfers and land mutations.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are Indian NRE, NRO, and Demat accounts claimed from Israel?",
    a: "Bank and depository nominees act only as temporary caretakers under the Supreme Court Sarbati Devi ruling. Nominees do not own the money. A clear Indian Will names your true heirs. This lets your family claim bank funds and shares quickly without a civil court succession certificate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Israel or India levy inheritance tax on inherited estates?",
    a: "Neither country levies inheritance tax. Israel ended estate tax in 1981, and India ended estate duty in 1985. But selling inherited Indian land later brings capital gains tax. Under Article 13 of the India-Israel tax treaty, taxes paid in India can be credited in Israel.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can heirs in Israel repatriate inherited property sale funds?",
    a: "Heirs first update land records using the Will. When selling, they obtain a Lower TDS Certificate under Section 197 to avoid 20% tax deduction. Under RBI rules, heirs can send up to 1 million USD per year to Israel using an NRO account and Form 15CA and 15CB.",

                Over 105,000 Indians and Jewish community members live across Tel
                Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Ramat Gan, and Ashdod. Under Israeli
                Inheritance Law 1965, succession defaults to your home city at
                death. Without an Indian Will, Israeli probate papers face huge delays
                in Indian courts. You can avoid this. A standalone Indian Will
                protects your flats, ancestral lands, and bank deposits. Our High
                Court lawyers draft clear Wills for peaceful asset transfer.

                Neither India nor Israel levies estate duty or inheritance tax. You
                inherit Indian assets tax-free. But selling real estate later brings
                capital gains tax. Indian buyers must deduct tax under Section 195.
                Our legal team helps you get a Lower TDS Certificate under Section 197.
                This saves you from high tax cuts upfront.

                Article 13 of the India-Israel tax treaty, double tax is avoided.
